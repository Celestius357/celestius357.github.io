    <h4><br/>Certifications: Energy Weapons, Engineering, Salvaging, Power Armor<p>Status: <b>UNKNOWN</b><br/>Location: <b>COMMONWEALTH</b><br/></p>
    <p><br/>[MEDICAL LOGS]<br/>Psychological Evalulation: Tenneko is a decisive person that has a strong belief in her own skills. Much of her life was spent learning and preparing herself. She may not know much of where she is and how things are now, but that is little issue. She has the skills to understand and to adapt.<br/>
    <br/>Definitive Traits: <br/>- <b>Adaptable</b> - Tenneko is a smart person, able to quickly understand and comprehend the situation and make alterations on the fly. Where her body lacks, technology and skill overcome.<br/>- <b>Technician</b> - By trade she is a technician and maintenance engineer. For most of her working life she tinkered and worked with technology. Mostly pre-war items, such as vault systems, power armor and energy weapons. She has an in-depth understanding of these pieces of history.<br/>
    <br/>Mental Deficencies: Despite her rather full of herself ideals, she suffers from much inner conflict. Depression has plagued much of her thoughts since the loss of her parents, then the loss of her mentor. Anxiety soon followed this by constant mortal thoughts of when it will be her time. A firm understanding came from this, “My time is up when its up.”
    <br/><br/> Physical Evalulation:<br/> Hair Color: Dirty Blonde<br/>Eye Color: Blue-Green<br/>Weight: 155 lb<br/>Height: 5'9"<br/>General Physical Traits: Tenneko is a slim woman with muscle built up, but in the form more of a runner. Her legs are muscled and her arms have a similar faint outline. The majority of her strength comes from her core and the tip-top physical condition.<br/>
    <br/><b>PRIVATE LOG</b>...<br/> Retrieving....<br/> “Due to unforeseen circumstances…” Those were the words I remembered the most. Every turning point in my life, every single one of them, had those words before it. When I was 10 I sat before this same Overseer as she told me of the accident that took my parents. Instantaneous depressurization of their workplace. The water rushed in and had instantly killed them both. Nothing was recovered. It had taken weeks to even contain the flooding. I remember sitting in that damp room sobbing till I couldn’t breath. Till the memories of them were nothing but that dark embrace of slumber. It was… not an easy time. Even thinking about it now causes every hair on my body to stand upright. The chill down my spine…<br/><br/>

    The Overseer cleared her throat when she realized I was no longer paying attention. Once she knew that not an ounce of it had sunk in.<br/><br/>
  
    “Due to unforeseen circumstances…” She started once more now that my attention was fixed on her. “Our only remaining Engineer has passed. Your teacher.” She said with a gentle sigh falling from her lips. It wasn’t any easier for her than it was for me. I sat next to her bed waiting and hoping that she would wake up. The doctor explained that she may never wake up and even if she did… she would not still be herself. Hypoxia had killed her, along with an underlying condition that caused her heart to fall into a rhythm that led to a stroke. Her brain, her most potent tool, was dead.<br/><br/>
  
    I could feel the tears well up at the bottom of my eyes. That itching sensation that burned deep into my eyes. I cleared my throat and nodded my head. “You are now the only one with any amount of training in her field. I know.. you are only sixteen. I know you haven’t learned everyhthing. I know it won’t be easy. But… you are our only hope for keeping this place running. Keeping those suits running. You can do it. You must do it…”<br/><br/>
  
    That’s all I could remember from that day. The rest of it passed in a blur. It was also my last day off. Every day after that I was kept busy. It was constant maintenance of the various robots we kept down here. Our power armor suits were in constant states of rusting and failure, it was only my unceasing work on them that kept them walking. The heavy plates and internals were somewhat protected by the corroding elements of the sea water, but it was never enough. Supply runs came back with more bulletholes in the plating than I could count. Servos cracked and growling in pain from impact after impact. If this was years ago maybe I would have fallen under, but now… Now this is all I have.<br/><br/>
  
    Except for those damned words again. Unforeseen circumstances. Only those words would have me stepping into a set of power armor and staring at the massive doors that protected me my whole life… staring in anxiety for what may be on the other side. My fingers itched and clawed at the internal controls, causing the metal fingers to do the same on the rough trigger of the plasma rifle.<br/><br/>
  
    “Why me?” “Why you?” “What if she doesn’t make it back?” “We are dead if she doesn’t go.” “If she doesn’t find him… we don’t even have years left. Months.” The conversation played over and over in my head. We were spread so thin. So weak. Only me. Only me, the T-45 and a plasma rifle. I felt my fingers tense tightly. Fear. Excitement. That spark.<br/><br/>
  
    The door had growled and howled as the massive mechanism pulled the door to the side. The magnets locking it in place as the service bridge extended outward. The servos whined as they carried the bulk of the armor forward.<br/><br/>
  
    A crackle sounded over the internal systems. “Be safe. Bring them back.” The Overseer’s words were not encouraging. They felt like a viper’s bite. But this… freedom…<br/><br/>
  
    I may not be a trained soldier. I may not know these wastes. But I know. I understand. I learn. I know these wastes will eat me up and spit me out without a second thought. “Fuck me… Here goes literally everything.” She mumbled to herself as she heard the airlock close behind her. A trickle of water at first before the entire room began to flood. It was cold. It was always cold…<br/><br/>
  
    The headlamp flicked on as the visor changed modes. Once the room had fully cycled the secondary door opened, revealing the encroaching darkness that was the sea. Her eyes set upon the series of lamps that acted as a path to the surface. With one step forward she started her descent to the sea floor… then the trek to the surface. Nothing about this felt safe. The lurking nothingness on either side of her vision. The grasping creeping cold that was all around her.<br/><br/>
  
    “Just. Walk.” She thought and started walking on. The path was as “safe” as it could get. A well traveled path. Lets see how well that holds up.<br/><br/>
  
  <b>SIX MONTHS LATER…</b><br/><br/>
  
    “The Commonwealth is much… regrown.” She said with a little sigh, looking at information filling her HUD. “Fusion core is looking good, but… food. Damn it.” She knelt down to pick up her large backpack, slinging it over the shoulder of the power armor. Her right hand held tightly on to the modified plasma rifle. A quick system check of both the T-45 and the plasma rifle. “All Systems Nominal.” Was the voice of the armor ringing through her skull.<br/><br/>
  
    “Thank you.” She murmured out and began her walk further into the Commonwealth. “So much more to see…” She felt the plasma rifle lurch slightly as the plasma was sucked into the chamber. The fusion core hummed a slight octave higher as the power router directed energy to the direct connected plasma rifle. Then… she took her first steps deeper into the Commonwealth.<br/><br/>

    Combat Skills & Competencies: While Tenneko was never properly trained for combat, nor is she a soldier by any stretch… she has the know how. It also helps that the Engineer is locked inside of a walking tank and equipped with a rather deadly Plasma weapon. Her combat skills would be in line with that of a raider, crude but effective. But she is blessed with a brain that isn’t riddled with chems and radiation, allowing her to think problems through… before she starts blastin’.<br/>
